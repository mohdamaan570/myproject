            <p>In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly
                rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is
                working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole.
                But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers
                through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new
                home.
                <br>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by
                Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen
                Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the
                film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home
                for humanity.</br></p>
